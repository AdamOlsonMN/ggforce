Title: Accelerating ggplot2
Version: 0.0.1

Description: The aim of ggplot2 is to aid in visual data investigations. This
    focus has led to a lack of facilities for composing specialised plots.
    ggforce Aims to be a collection of mainly new stats and geoms that fills
    this gap. All additional functionality is aimed to come through the official
    extension system so using ggforce should be a stable experience.

\usage{
geom_mark_circle(mapping = NULL, data = NULL, stat = "identity",
  position = "identity", expand = unit(5, "mm"), radius = 0, n = 100,
  ..., na.rm = FALSE, show.legend = NA, inherit.aes = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[=aes]{aes()}} or
\code{\link[=aes_]{aes_()}}. If specified and \code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the
default), it is combined with the default mapping at the top level of the
plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[=ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[=fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame.}, and
will be used as the layer data.}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this
layer, as a string.}

\item{position}{Position adjustment, either as a string, or the result of
a call to a position adjustment function.}

\item{expand}{A numeric or unit vector of length one, specifying the
expansion amount. Negative values will result in contraction instead. If the
value is given as a numeric it will be understood as a proportion of the
plot area width.}

\item{radius}{As \code{expand} but specifying the corner radius.}

\item{n}{The number of points used to draw each circle. Defaults to \code{100}}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \code{\link[=layer]{layer()}}. These are
often aesthetics, used to set an aesthetic to a fixed value, like
\code{color = "red"} or \code{size = 3}. They may also be parameters
to the paired geom/stat.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[=borders]{borders()}}.}

\description{
This geom lets you annotate sets of points via circles. The enclosing circles
are calculated at draw time and the most optimal enclosure at the given
aspect ratio is thus guaranteed. As with the other \code{geom_mark_*} geoms the
enclosure is expanded sligtly to fully contain the enclosed points.
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

geom_mark_hull understand the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in
bold):
\itemize{
\item \strong{x}
\item \strong{y}
\item filter
\item color
\item fill
\item group
\item size
\item linetype
\item alpha
}
}

\examples{
ggplot(iris, aes(Petal.Length, Petal.Width)) +
  geom_mark_circle(aes(fill = Species, filter = Species != 'versicolor')) +
  geom_point()
